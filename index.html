					## Overview

					* Setup
					* UNIX
					* bash
					* writing bash scripts
					* some bash scripts

					Note:
					So for this session I'll be going through several things, a bit about UNIX, a bit about bash, and a bit about writing bash scripts.

					But before we get to this, I'd like to ensure that you have your Vagrant installation set up.
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Setting up Vagrant


						* If you've downloaded vagrant and the image from the internet, great!

						Note:
						So, if you already have Vagrant set up, that's great!
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Otherwise

						* Copy the vagrant folder from the thumb drive to your user folder
						* Install Vagrant
							* Windows: Vagrant_1.3.1.msi
							* OS X: Vagrant_1.3.1.dmg
							* Debian/Ubuntu: use apt-get
						* Open a terminal
						* Navigate to the vagrant directory
							* Windows: dir, cd
							* OS X/Linux: ls, cd
						* Type in
							* vagrant add precise32 precise32.box
							* vagrant up
							* vagrant ssh

						Note:
						But if you have yet to set up Vagrant, we are passing USBs around, and in them are what you need to install vagrant. So copy the vagrant folder to your user folder or home folder (for convenience), and run the appropriate installer. For Debian and Ubuntu, I suggest you do sudo apt-get vagrant instead.

						So once you have Vagrant installed fire up a terminal and navigate to the folder. For Windows users that means cmd.exe, and for OS X and Linux users that means your Terminal. To go into a folder, use the cd command. To list the commands in your current folder, use dir.

						When you're in the vagrant directory in your terminal, type in these commands.

						The first will tell your Vagrant installation to add the precise32.box image to your installation's virtual machines.

						The second will bring it up.

						The last command will ssh you into your virtual machine.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						##  Why Vagrant?

						* Vagrant is a virtual machine tool
						* We'll be using a 32-bit Ubuntu Precise as our environment
						* Ubuntu is a common choice if you're administrating cloud servers.

						Note:
						Now, I want to talk a bit on why we are using Vagrant.

						Now why use Vagrant and why Ubuntu? We use vagrant so that we can all run in the same environment; there are differnces between the tools used in OS X and cygwin and Solaris and Ubuntu. Using the same OS will make it easier for you and me.

						Why Ubuntu? That's quite an arbitrary choice, but it's about the most popular free OS you can find. That means that if you're doing something like spinning up a cloud server on Amazon Web Services you'll most likely want to use an Ubuntu instance.
					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## UNIX

						* UNIX and Unix-like systems
						* Unix directory structure
						* Unix programs
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## UNIX and Unix-like systems

						* Unix
							* Solaris
						* BSD
							* Darwin / OS X
							* OpenBSD
						* Linux (GNU utilities)
							* Ubuntu
							* Red Hat Enterprise Linux

						Note:
						So now that we're done with setting up the virtual machine, let's take a step back. So, broadly, UNIX and Unix-like operating systems can be classified under three families, the original, proprietary Unix line, the BSD family, and the GNU/Linux family. I'll just refer to all of them as Unix.

						So, what I've heard is that there is a lot of overlap between Unix and BSD and that commands in both those systems behave somewhat the same.

						Linux, however, has of its programs a lot different from Unix and BSD. I won't talk about that right now, though.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Directory Structure

						Note:
						Now let's talk about the filesystem. Unix filesystems don't have a C: drive or a D: drive. In windows your C: and D: drives corresponded to actual partitions on your hard disks. So if you draw a map for a Windows filesystem, it will look like several trees. In Unix, however, as opposed to having multiple trees, there is only one tree, and the topmost directory is called the root directory, noted by '/'.

						If you connect a drive to your computer, and mount it, most often you will be mounting it in 
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/FS-layout.png">
						<aside class="notes">
						<p>So here's how it looks like. Now, you don't have to remember all of this, and the structure changes from Unix system to Unix system.</p>
						<p>But there are some things you should remember.</p>
						<p>For instance, generally speaking, the /bin folder stores all the most common Unix programs. 'bin' stands for binary. The /sbin folder stores programs that can only be run with superuser/Administrator permissions.</p>
						<p>The /etc folder stores your system configuration files</p>
						<p>The /tmp folder stores temporary files.</p>
						<p>The /usr folder stores all kinds of programs and stuff specific to your particular installation but accessible by all users</p>
						<p>The /home folder, which in OS X is the /Users folder, stores user home directories</p>
						<p>The /mnt and /media folders are where you would normally find your partitions on external media as folders</p>
						<p>The /boot folder contains files that are run when you start up your computer</p>
						<p>The /dev folder contains interfaces to your physical devices</p>
						<p>The /proc folder contains interfaces to your processes</p>
						<p>The /var directory contains a lot of installation specific stuff that are expected to change as the system runs</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Unix programs

						* Run with arguments
						* Exposed to environment
						* File descriptors and file streams
							* 0, 1, 2 connected to STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR
							* The shell can redirect file streams
						* return value


							$ cat
							Hello World!
							$ cat file1 file2
							$ cat nosuchfile
							$ cat file1 nosuchfile 2>&1 1> output.log | tee error.log


						Note:
						Now that we know a bit of how a Unix filesystem looks like, let's talk about the programs that run in Unix. So Unix programs, are run from the shell, which in our case is the bash shell. When we run these programs, we can send it arguments.

						In addition, these programs run in an environment, which I will talk about kater.

						So in the above example, at line 2, I have passed into the cat program it two arguments, file1 and file2.

						When it runs, by default it opens three streams, standard input, standard output, and standard error. This is how a Unix program usually interacts with the shell and user input.

						And later on I'll talk about the return value of a program.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						# Redirection

							echo 'This is standard output'
							echo 'This is file 1' > file1
							echo 'This is file 2' > file2
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/cat diagram.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>So what you see here is a data flow diagram of what happens when you run the cat program. You might want to try it now. So I'll just be typing c-a-t-enter, and nothing happens.</p>
							<p>cat is program that reads in files, then prints them out into standard output. That is if you give it arguments. If you don't, it reads in from standard input instead. Now this behavior of reading in from standard inpt is immensely useful, and we'll see why later.</p>
							<p>Now if you type hello world and press enter, what will happen when you press enter is that cat will read in what you have just typed, and print it out to the screen.

						## The bash Shell

						Note:
						Great! We've just run a couple programs from the bash shell! Now let's learn more about the shell.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## The Prompt

							$
							user@hostname:~$
							# '~' is shorthand for user directory
							root@hostname:~#
							user@hostname:~$ command arg1 arg2 "arg 3" arg4 5


						Press ↑ to look at previous commands.

						Note:
						So here's the prompt you're seeing on your screen.

						If you're a normal user, it's usually a dollar sign.
						There's sometimes some information before the dollar sign, and you are able to customize it. I won't be telling you how to do that, but if we have free time you can ask me.

						In this case, user is my username, and hostname is the name of the computer. The tilde sign means that I'm at my user home directory.

						If you're the superuser root, you'll usually see a hash sign just so to remind you to be careful.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Some Basic commands

							echo 'Hello World'
							pwd
							ls
							cd [folder in current location]
							cd /[folder in root directory]
							# help commands
							man pwd
							help cd
							head --help | less

						Note:
						So here are some basic commands that you will probably be using.

						Here's echo, which prints its arguments to standard output.

						pwd tells you your current location.

						ls shows you all the files and folders in your current directory. But if you 

						if you run cd, and your argument does not start with a slash, you are going to go to that directory, relative to your current location. That means that say I run ls and I see a folder1, if I type cd folder1 I will go to that directory. Now ls shows me that there isn't anything in this newly created directory. But if I type cd '/home', I will be taken to the home directory instead.

						man is a program that will give you documentation for a program that you run on your shell.

						But some commands you give to bash are not programs. For that you use help.

						Another way to get help is to tack on the --help argument to the end of a program.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Redirection

							command 1> output.log # redirect to output.log
							command 2>&1 # redirect 2 to 1.

						Note:
						Remember the greater than and vertical bar symbols in the previous chapter?

						This is shell functionality. Redirecting standard input and standard output to either a file or another program is handled by the shell.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Variables

						* Variable names consist of digits [0-9], letters [A-Za-z], or an underscore _, but cannot begin with a digit.


							MY_VAR="this string" # defining a variable
							# There must not be any whitespace around the equals sign
							echo $MY_VAR # equivalent to "echo this string"
							echo "$MY_VAR" # equivalent to 'echo "this string"'
							echo '$MY_VAR' # equivalent to "echo '$MY_VAR'"
							echo ${MY_VAR}er # equivalent to "echo this stringer"
							echo $I_AM_NOT_DEFINED

						Note:

						You can define variables in the shell. Variables in bash are always strings. To use them in a command, add a dollar sign before the variable name. When you run a command with a variable, bash will first substitute the variable's value wherever it sees the variable name. We call this substitution interpolation.

						However, bash does not interpolate anything in single quotes.

						If you have letters, digits, or underscores after the variable, you have to escape the variable name by enclosing it in curly braces.

						If the variable is not yet defined, it interpolates to an empty string.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Environment

						* shell contains an environment; environment is a name-value array.
						* programs can see and change environment. In C, getenv(), setenv()
							* e.g. man uses $PAGER
							* e.g. git commit launches $VISUAL (if $GIT_EDITOR is not defined)
						* to make a shell variable an environment variable, use the keyword export

								export MY_VAR
								export ANOTHER_VAR="variable value"

								printenv
								unset ANOTEHR_VAR

						Note:

						But sometimes you want to change the environment. The environment can affect the execution of programs. For example, when you run the man program, it looks at $PAGER and uses it to launch a program that will help you scroll through files.

						Let's have a try. As you can see, PAGER is currently set to less. Let's try looking at the man page of which. As you can see, man has launched the less program.  If I press j I scroll down. Let me change $PAGER to cat. export PAGER=cat Let's try that again.

						If you want to have a look at the environment, type env.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Search Path and Return Value

							echo $PATH
							echo $(IFS=:; set -- $line; printf "%s\n" "$@") # one-liner to print on separate lines
							notaprogram
							echo $?
						
						Note:

						There's one super important environment variable and that is the search path. Let's have a look at PATH. It's a colon separated list of locations. What do these mean?

						These locations are directories, not individual files. When you type in a command like cat, what happens is that the shell looks into each of these directories from left to right for a file named cat. If it finds such a file and it has permission to execute it, the shell tries to execute that program. Otherwise it looks into the next directory. If it is not found, an error is printed, and the previous return value is set to 127.

						The previous return value is stored in the variable $?. Programs that execute successfully often have a return value of 0, while programs that execute unsuccessfully have a return value of 1.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## More on programs

							which cat
							which cd
							which bash

						Note:
						If you want to know the exact location of the program that you've just executed, you can use the which program. It will print to you the location of the program that you will execute when you type it.

						## Intermission: Repositories and Installing Software

						* Using sed to find and replace
						* Repositories are "app stores" for Linux programs

						Note:
						Okay, we've gone through quite a bit. We'll be having a break, but first let's try to install some software.

						You need an Internet connection for this, so for those who aren't NUS students, you might want to tether. It's a couple hundred megabytes of data. You can tether from my phone, but I'd appreciate it if you used your own.

						A little bit about repositories. Repositories were the first app stores. A Ubuntu and Debian system had what we call a package manager that helped you install and uninstall stuff cleanly. To get software, and to update software, you connect to a repository and download a list that told you what packages have been updated, then you can choose to download and install the new software itself.

						So, just like an app store.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Using sed to find and replace

							cd /etc/apt
							cat sources.list
							sudo cp sources.list sources.list.bak
							sed 's/us.archive.ubuntu.com/mirror.nus.edu.sg/' sources.list.bak
							sed 's/\(us.archive.ubuntu.com\|security.ubuntu.com\)/mirror.nus.sg' \
								sources.list.bak
							sed 's/\(us.archive.ubuntu.com\|security.ubuntu.com\)/mirror.nus.sg' \
								sources.list.bak > ~/sources.list
							sudo mv sources.list .

						Note:
						Now, how does Ubuntu know where the repository is located? It looks into the /etc/apr/sources.list file. Let's have a look at it.

						You see these URLs? They refer to some server located in the US. Now, NUS has its own Ubuntu repository as well, that mirrors the default ones. So let's change these urls to NUS's repository by replacing the url.

						sed stands for stream editor. What it does, is it reads a file line by line, then does some stuff to each line before outputting it to standard output.
						Now what I've just typed replaces all instances of us.archive.ubuntu.com with mirror.nus.edu.sg and then prints it to the standard output.

						This next line, with the escaped parentheses and the vertical bar, is a form of what we call regular expressions. In this case, what this means is that you substitute all instances of us.archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com with mirror.nus.edu.sg . If you want to know more about regular expressions, there are many resources on it on the internet.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## 

							sudo apt-get update
							sudo apt-get install vim exiv2

						Note:
						So let's start installing! The first command fetches the list of packages mirror.nus.edu.sg has to offer, while the second command installs the vim and exov2 programs. Vim is a text editor, while exiv2 is a program that reads the metadata of JPEG files.

					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Writing a script

						* The shebang
						* Permissions
						* Executing a script from the shell

						Note:

						Is everyone back? Right. We'll get started writing a couple scripts.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## The shebang

							sudo apt-get install vim # (or emacs)

							vim hello_world.sh

							echo "Hello World."

							bash hello_world.sh

						Adding a shebang


							#!/bin/bash

							echo "Hello World Again."

							./hello_world.sh
							bash hello_world.sh

						Note:
						So let's write a 'Hello World script'. Open your editor. I like vim, and type 'echo "Hello World."'. Then close your editor, and then type "bash hello_world.sh" But thats really too slow and tedious.

						We can execute it directly, but you will have to add something. You have to add a shebang to the top of your file. It's just one line and looks like that. When the shell is trying to execute hello_world.sh, it looks in the first line for the path to the program it should be execued under.

						After that, you will be able to execute the file by ./hello_world.sh ; but not right now. I'll talk about that in a bit.

						One popular alternative is using the env command. Sometimes users have special versions of the program that they want to use, and these may perhaps not be in the $PATH. The env command, when used like this, will get bash to execute the script.

						If you try executing it with bash, it does indeed work.

						So let's try to find out why ./hello_world.sh doesn't work.

					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Permissions

							ls -l | grep hello_world.sh

						* Files:
							* r 4 (is readable)
							* w 2 (is writable)
							* x 1 (is executable)


							chmod 764 hello_world.sh
							chmod u+x hello_world.sh


						* Directories
							* r 4 (able to list files in directory)
							* w 2 (able to edit, add, delete files in directory)
							* x 1 (required to access files in directory)

						Note:
						ls -l gives us quite a bit of metadata information about our files. It prints the information of each file each in its own line. Since we're only interested in hello_world.sh, we'll pipe it to grep; and grep will filter away all the lines that does not contain the substring hello_world.sh .

						So the reason why it doesn't work is that it does not have any executable permissions. Let's look at the permissions of hello_world.sh . The first column reads -rw-rw-r-- . The second to fourth character means that you have read and write permissions but no execute permissions. The next rw- means that the same applies to users who share the same group as you. The last r-- means that everyone else only has permissions to read this file.

						To give yourself execute permissions, you can run chmod u+x hello_world.sh . Alternatively, you can use numbers. Just add up the numbers. 7 is 4+2+1 for the user, 6 is 4+2 for the group, and 4 is just read permission for others.

					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Executing it

							./hello_world.sh
							cd /
							$OLDPWD/hello_world.sh

							mkdir bin
							export PATH="~/bin:$PATH"
							mv hello_world.sh bin/hello_world
							hello_world

						Note:
						So now that we have permissions, let's try executing it. Now the sintax here is a little interesting. The dot means the current directory, and hello_world.sh refers to the script that we've just created.

						One of the interesting things you can do is ha

					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Creating a script

							cat <<'EOS' > hello_world.sh
							#!/bin/bash

							echo "Hello World"
							EOS

							chmod u+x hello_world.sh
							alias chx='chmod u+x'
							./hello_world.sh

						Note:
						Here's a short summary on how to create a hello_world script. The double left arrows mean that what's going to follow is a heredoc. Everything until the EOS line will be turned into a string and passed into cat as standard input. And the output will be written into hello_world.sh

						We make hello_world.sh executable, and then we run it.

					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## A more interesting script

						### Motivation

						Rename an entire folder of JPEG photo files based on their timestamp.

							wget http://bit.ly/15d2lrN # image1.jpg
							wget http://bit.ly/16vrIW0 # image2.jpg
							exiv2 15d2lrN
							exiv2 16vrIW0

						* Getting the timestamp
						* Intermission: subshells
						* Testing
						* Reading in arguments
						* Get options

						Note:
						Now let's get our hands dirty with a more interesting script.

						Let's download two image files using wget.

						Let's open them using exiv2. exiv2 shows you the EXIF metadata attached to pictures that you've taken with a camera. Now, I've artificially generated the EXIF metadata for these two files, so it looks quite sparse.

						So maybe you're a photographer, and you have some photos to transfer over, but your different cameras take photos and write them to different filenames that tell you nothing. You want to rename these files so that they are sorted by time.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Getting the timestamp

							exiv2 15d2lrN | grep "Image timestamp" | cut -d ' ' -f 4,5
							exiv2 15d2lrN | grep "Image timestamp" | cut -d ' ' -f 4,5 \
								| sed 's/\(.*\) \(.*\)/\1T\2.jpg/'
							# alternatively, without substituting space with T
							exiv2 15d2lrN | grep "Image timestamp" | cut -d ' ' -f 4,5 \
								| sed 's/$/\1.jpg/'

						Note:
						Let's see if we can get the timestamp of the file. We use exiv2 to print the metadata, grep to filter the part that we're interested, then we use cut to get the column that we're interested.

						The -d option tells cut to separate fields by spaces. The -f 4,5 tells cut that we're interested in the 4th and fifth columns.

						This timestame is almost the ISO format for date and time. One cool thing about the ISO format is that if you sort these timestamps alphabetically, you will display them from the oldest to the newest.

						Now I don't like spaces in my filenames, so I'm going to use sed to replace spaes with a T.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Intermission: Subshells

						* Problem: Not all files contain EXIF data


							echo $(cat nosuchfile file1)
							echo $(cat nosuchfile $PWD/file1 2> /dev/null)
							echo $(exiv2 file1 2> /dev/null | grep "Image timestamp")
							#no output
							man null

						Note:
						There's a problem. Not all files are image files, and not all image files contain EXIF data. You can't rename these files. We cannot expect the file passed into exiv2 to have an EXIF timestamp.

						We can handle these cases, and one way to do it is use a subshell.

						When bash sees a $ followed by a single pair of parentheses, what it does is invoke another bash shell, and run the commands within the parentheses. We call this other bash shell a subshell. The subshell will collect the standard output, but immediately print standard error to the terminal.

						Then, it interpolates the everything in the $() with the standard output.

						The /dev/null you see here is a special file. You can see what it does by looking at man null.

						Data written to a null or zero special file is discarded.

						It is a common practice to redirect unwanted output to /dev/null.


					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
						## Testing

						* Problem: Not all files contain EXIF data

						

							[ "$(exiv2 file1 2> /dev/null | grep "Image timestamp" \
								| cut -d ' ' -f 4,5)" == '' ]
							echo $?
							[ "$(exiv2 file1 | grep "Image timestamp" \
								| cut -d ' ' -f 4,5)" == '' ]
							echo $?
							man [

						Note:
						There's a unix program called test, which has an alternate form, which is this left bracket. The test program reads in the arguments, and evaluates it like an expression. Its return value tells you whether it is true or false. 0 means true, and 1 means false. Note that this is opposite from the true and false values of C.

						And so now we know how to test if the file can be renamed.

							chx rename_images
							./rename_images arg1 "arg 2" arg3


						Note:
						You can read arguments into a script with $@. Now $@ is a little special. It preserves arguments with spaces in them if you quote it.

						So let's try running this.

						## Putting it together

							vim rename_images

							#!/bin/bash

							for FILENAME in "$@"
							do
								export FILENAME
								NEWNAME="$(exiv2 $FILENAME | grep "Image timestamp" |"\
									" cut -d ' ' -f 4,5 | sed 's/\(.*\) \(.*\)/\1T\2.jpg/')"

								# don't forget to quote
								if [ "$NEWNAME" != "" ] # equivalent to [ -n "$NEWNAME" ]
								then
									mv "$FILENAME" "$NEWNAME"
								elif [ ! -e "$FILENAME" ] # file does not exist
								then
									echo "$0: $FILENAME: No such file" 1>&2
								else
									echo "$0: $FILENAME: No EXIF timestamp" 1>&2
								fi
							done

						Note:
						for loop

						if, based on return value

						quotes around variables

						* vim rename_images

									e)
										export EXTENSION="$OPTARG"
										;;
									\?)
										echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG" >&2

								NEWNAME="$(exiv2 $FILENAME | grep "Image timestamp" | cut -d ' ' -f 4,5 | sed 's/\(.*\) \(.*\)/\1T\2'"$EXTENSION"'/')"

						## Script to Rename files by EXIF timestamp

						* More piping, piping through sed
						* Subshells
						* Shell Tests
						* Reading in arguments
						* Get options

						Time for another break!

						Last part's gonna be relaxed.
